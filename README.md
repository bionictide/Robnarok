Robnarok Mod Pack

To install/Update download the RobnarokModPack.zip file to your desktop(or somewhere you'll be able to find it). 
Right click the zip file and click "Extract All"
Select a suitable location to extract the file (The default is where you saved the zip file, I recommend the desktop)
Open Steam and find Valheim in your library.
Right click on Valheim in the steam launcher and click "Manage> Browse Local Files"
This is your Valheim directory
Now open the RobnarokModPack folder containing the files you unzipped earlier.
Highlight all of the files in RobnarokModPack (CTRL A) and drag them into your Valheim directory.
If you have already installed RobnarokModPack and you are updating to the newest version it may ask if you would like to Replace or Skip Files with similar names.
Click "Replace the files in the destination"
The files will now be updated, that's it. You're good to go!
Launch Valheim and keep the console window that opens running in the background.
Have fun!
